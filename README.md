This is a class project related to directed and undirected graphs. A PDF with all project details, Assignment5.pdf,  is contained in this repository. The project consistes of three parts:

- Reading in directed graph specifications from a text file, representing the graph with an adjacency list, and answer adjacency queries provided in another text file.
- Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue. This will allow the program to find the shortest paths and costs from a given starting vertex to all vertices in the graph file.
- Implementing the topological sorting algorithm which computes a sequence of vertices that satisfy the topological sorting sequence. The output should be the sequence of vertices or if a cycle is detected, notify the user and terminate the program. 

Please note that this project employs some code, used with the permission of the professor, from the course textbook; instances of this should be clear from the head comments in the source files.
